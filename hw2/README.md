Part 1: Data Exploration and Visualization 

Load the HW2.csv (can be found under Files on Canvas).
Calculate and report basic statistics for each variable (mean, median, standard deviation).
Create scatter plots for each independent variable against the house price.
Write a brief paragraph interpreting these plots.
Part 2: Correlation Analysis

Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between house price and each independent variable.
Interpret the correlation coefficients. Which variable has the strongest correlation with price? What does this mean?
Part 3: Linear Regression – 1 IV

Choose the independent variable with the strongest correlation to price.
Implement simple linear regression using the least squares method. 
Plot the regression line along with the scatter plot of your chosen variable vs. price.
Calculate the R-squared value for your model.
Interpret the meaning of the slope and intercept in the context of house prices.
Part 4: Residual Analysis 

Calculate the residuals for your simple linear regression model.
Create visualization of the residuals.
Interpret this visualization. What does it suggest about your model?
Part 5: Linear Regression – all IVs

Perform linear regression using all independent variables.
Compare the R-squared value of this model to your 1-IV linear regression model.
Interpret the coefficients of the multiple regression model.
Part 6: Implement k-fold cross-validation (k=5) for your simple linear regression model. Explain how this helps in assessing the model's performance.
