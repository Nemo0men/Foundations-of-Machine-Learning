Submission Requirements:

Submit a Python notebook (.ipynb file) containing all your code and visualizations.
Include separate CSV files for any datasets you generate as part of your work.
Compress all files (notebook and datasets) into a single ZIP archive for submission.
 

Task 1: Bernoulli Simulation

1. Objective: Perform a series of Bernoulli simulations (varying two values described below) and visualizations of the sample mean.

2. Instructions:

First Variable: Number of observations in a single simulation, with values [10, 100, 1000, 10000].
Second Variable: Number of times to run a Bernoulli simulation (with p=0.7) for each set of observations, with values [10, 100, 1000, 10000].
For each combination of values, simulate the dataset. For each combination of variables, record the sample mean for each run as its own dataset. Example: For 100 runs of a 10 observation Bernoulli dataset, generate a dataset where each of the 100 rows consists of the sample mean from a different run with 10 observations.
Submit each of these sample mean datasets as a separate CSV file. Each file should contain one mean per line.
3. Visualization and Interpretation:

Produce a visualization of the distribution of sample means for each dataset created.
Include a brief commentary as a comment in your Python notebook about the trends you observe as the number of runs and number of observations vary.
 

Task 2: Analysis of `HW1_dataset1.csv`

1. Visualization:

Create at least one visualization to depict the feature(s) in this dataset.
2. Distribution Modeling:

Select a distribution that you believe models the feature effectively.
Justify your choice in a comment block within your notebook.
3. Parameter Estimation:

Estimate the parameters of your chosen distribution based on the data.
Overlay the estimated distribution on your data visualization for comparison.
 

Task 3: Analysis of `HW1_dataset2.csv`

Instructions are identical to Task 2. Follow the same steps for `HW1_dataset2.csv`.
 

Task 4: Visualization of `HW1_dataset3.csv`

1. Objective:

Generate a meaningful and clear visualization of the two-feature dataset contained in `HW1_dataset3.csv`.
2. Visualization Considerations:

Your visualization should be informative, showing relationships or patterns between the two features.
Ensure clarity and effectiveness in conveying the data insights.
 

Submission:

Combine your Python notebook and all generated datasets into a single ZIP file named LASTNAME_HW1.zip.
Ensure all visualizations and explanations are clear and concise.
Upload the ZIP file.
